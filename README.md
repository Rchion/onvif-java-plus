 描述
---
本项目是基于ONVIF-Java(https://github.com/RootSoft/ONVIF-Java)的个人使用特化,由于原开源项目现已归档,其中存在例如回放、云台、事件等ONVIF所支持而项目无法做到的功能,加上gradle的作为构建工具
较为难使用，因此本项目在原来基础上改成了Maven项目更符合现在Java项目的使用，使其更加易用，同时增加了一些新的功能，例如回放、云台、事件等

Description
---
This project is based on ONVIF-Java (https://github.com/RootSoft/ONVIF-Java) for personal use. Since the original open source project has been archived, there are functions such as playback, PTZ, events, etc. that ONVIF supports but the project cannot do. In addition, gradle is difficult to use as a build tool. Therefore, this project has been changed to a Maven project based on the original one, which is more suitable for the use of current Java projects, making it easier to use. At the same time, some new functions have been added, such as playback, PTZ, events, etc.
